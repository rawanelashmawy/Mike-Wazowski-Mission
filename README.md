# Mike-Wazowski-Mission
When Mike Wazowski and James Sullivan take in Boo and hide her in their home, they realize that they have to feed her and bring her toys to make sure she stays quite. Since James is better at taking care of Boo, Mike is the one that will go out to bring food and come back home. Will he be able to do so?

Mike starts inside the house, you should collect the toys inside the house without colliding with the furniture (obstacles) then go to the front door to go outside. You should collect enough money to be able to buy food from the vending machine. Your score should be at least 30.
